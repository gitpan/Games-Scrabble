=head1 NAME

B<Games::Scrabble> -- validate and generate scrabble words

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Games::Scrabble;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Games::Scrabble> provides functiones to validate and generate words 
of Scrabble game.
 
    validate($mywordlist, [word1, word2, word3...]). 

If mywordlist is not given, the 'wordlist' in current working 
directory will be used.  

    generate({ letters => "letters and blanks", 
	           len => "mininum_length, maximum_length", # default 2,7 
	            re => 'regexes',	    # use single quotes or q||! 
	      wordlist => "......."  } )

Print out scrabble words meet the requirements. B<len> represents minimum
and maximum length of the target word, B<re> represents the regex matches 
against the target words. use "?" to represent blank tiles.
B<wordlist> is optional, see validate() above.

Note that repeated letters should be B<all> listed, to indicate how many 
of them may be used.

Example 1:

    generate({letters => "aquabt?", 
                  len => "2,4", 
	           re => '/q/ && !/u/'});


    qat
    qats

use a(up to 2, actually 3 in this case, since ? can represent a), q, u, t, 
b and blank tiles to generate 2,3 or 4-letter words contain q but not u, 
and use 'wordlist' located in current working directory. 

Example 2:

    generate({letters => "??"});

find out all valid 2-letters.


Example 3:

    validate(["qat","qatw"]);

find out if "qat", "qatw" are acceptable.

=head1 TRICK and TIPS

You may purposely use more blank tiles (?) to see what kind of tile 
exchange could bring you a bingo.

=head1 TODOS

More flexible word generator, score calculator etc. Please send comments
